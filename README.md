This is a simple python script that will generate random numbers. We take inputs for the min number, max number, and amount of numbers we want.
The program prints statements telling you what to input, but I reccomend putting the output in a text file to store the numbers and not just have them printed.

For example, on a unix system you would run it like:

python random_generator.py > numbers.txt
1
10
100

There will be no statements on what you need to enter, so you have to input the min number, press enter, input the max number, press enter, and input the amount of numbers, and hit enter. This will then put the numbers into the file "numbers.txt" in the same directory.
